# App

This command instantiates the application (PyOps) within a repo...

_See [Creating a Repo](./repo.md) from the repo command._

Once the app command is invoked:

```bash
pfo app
```

The CLI will prompt you for some information - once complete, the application will be installed into
the current repo.
